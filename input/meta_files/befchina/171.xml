<para>Sand-filled splash cups were used to study the erosivity of rainfall and throughfall in the humid subtropics of southeast China in spring and summer 2010. Our results showed that the splash cup measurements yielded precise and reproducible results both under open field conditions and under forest vegetation. The splash cups were exposed to forest stands of different age and to selected species  in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR). This dataset contains the measurements performed under selected trees.</para>

<geographicDescription>The Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (NNR) is located in the western part of Zhejiang Province (29º8'18&quot; – 29º17'29&quot; N, 118º2'14&quot; – 118º11'12&quot; E, Fig. 1).  The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu &amp; Yu 2008), which have not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana. --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles. Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved. --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C, January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C and an accumulated temperature sum (≥ 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days.</geographicDescription>

<samplingDescription>
<para>Plot specific measurements: 15 splash cups were set up on random positions within a CSP. The splash cups consist of a PE flask to which a carrier system has been attached. In this carrier system a cup filled with a unit sand of 125-200 µm particle size is inserted. At the bottom of the cup a silk cover prevents loss of sand and guarantees free drainage of water from the cup to the carrier and vice versa. Cup and PE flask are hydraulically connected by a cotton wick to ensure constant moisture content throughout the time of measuring, as the initial water content is a crucial point in splash erosion studies (Poesen and Savat 1981). Additionally, vents in the carrier system ensure that the pressure arising from the insertion of the cup does not lead to loss of sand. The vent in the PE flask guarantees the free drainage of excess water which may accumulate during high intensity rainfall events. For this file 15 splashcups were randomly distributed in each CSP.</para>

Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) and B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
Morover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) or Site B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the &quot;site&quot; information from another cell.

<attributeLabel>position_scb</attributeLabel>
<attributeDefinition>Categories with &quot;P&quot; and a number indicate splashcups installed in the Main Experimental set up.
Other entries indicate splashcups positioned in the Comparative study plots. 
General information: The splash cups consist of a PE flask to which a carrier system has been attached. In this carrier system a cup filled with a unit sand of 125-200 µm particle size is inserted. At the bottom of the cup a silk cover prevents loss of sand and guarantees free drainage of water from the cup to the carrier and vice versa. Cup and PE flask are hydraulically connected by a cotton wick to ensure constant moisture content throughout the time of measuring, as the initial water content is a crucial point in splash erosion studies (Poesen and Savat 1981). Additionally, vents in the carrier system ensure that the pressure arising from the insertion of the cup does not lead to loss of sand. The vent in the PE flask guarantees the free drainage of excess water which may accumulate during high intensity rainfall events. (position_scb: position of the Splash Cup within the measuring pentagon)</attributeDefinition>

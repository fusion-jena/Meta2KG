<abstract>
<para>Pitfall traps (four traps per plot, located at the corners of the central 10 x 10 m subplot) were used to assess the activity abundance and species richness of Formicidae in relation to the plots&#39; woody plant diversity. The data allow to test to what extent woody plant diversity affects the abundance, species composition and diversity of, e.g. predators (which might profit from higher structural diversity or better resource availability in more plant diverse plots) or opportunists (which might profit from more diverse resources in more plant diverse plots). Traps consisted of plastic cups (diameter 8.5 cm, depth 15 cm, capacity 550 ml) sunk into the ground and filled with 150 ml of preserving solution (40% ethanol, 30% water, 20% glycerol, 10% acetic acid, with a few drops of detergent to reduce surface tension) for continuous trapping. Sampling was conducted in 2009 for five months (30 March–2 September) and covered the main growing season. The traps were emptied and refilled at 14 day intervals. Taxa were sorted in the lab and specimens were identified to species or morphospecies level (within genera).</para>

<para>CSPs: Ants (Formicidae) of pitfall traps in the CSPs 2009</para>
<para>Pitfall traps (four traps per plot, located at the corners of the central 10 x 10 m subplot) were used to assess the activity abundance and species richness of Formicidae in relation to the plots&#39; woody plant diversity. The data allow to test to what extent woody plant diversity affects the abundance, species composition and diversity of, e.g. predators (which might profit from higher structural diversity or better resource availability in more plant diverse plots) or opportunists (which might profit from more diverse resources in more plant diverse plots).

For plant woody species richness, refer to the dataset &quot;Comparative study plot (CSP) information to be shared with all BEF-China scientists&quot; (http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/205). ---  As in ants most ecological information is shared between members of a genus, the genus names are provided as separate data colum. ---- For general comparisons between sites subfamily data are usefull.

<attributeDefinition>Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve (29º8'18&quot; – 29º17'29&quot; N, 118º2'14&quot; – 118º11'12&quot; E, Zhejiang Province Southeast China), having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) and B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
Morover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) or Site B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the &quot;site&quot; information from another cell.
Plots labelled in the form of &quot;1_AO1&quot; or &quot;g1_AO1&quot; or &quot;pilot1_AO1&quot; belong to the &quot;Pilot Experiment&quot; (approx location:  29°06'20.2&quot;N 117°55'12.1&quot;E, Jiangxi Province) (CSP: Number of the Comparative Study Plot; Datagroup description: BEF research plot name; Datagroup description: Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China).

<samplingDescription>
<para>Six depth increments were taken from systematic corings: Nine corings per plot were pooled to one sample per depth increment (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 cm). Sampling was then reduced to five depth increments (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). Samples were air-dried, sieved &lt; 2mm, grinded using a ball mill.

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Al and H were measured with an ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer DV 5300 ICP OES). The soil samples were percolated with an unbuffered 1 M NH4Cl solution (effective cation exchange capacity). Base saturation percentage (BS) was calculated as proportion of the CEC accounted for by exchangeable bases Na, K, Mg and Ca.</para>

<attributeDefinition>In soil science, cation-exchange capacity or CEC is the number of exchangeable cations per dry weight that a soil is capable of holding, at a given pH value, and available for exchange with the soil water solution.[1] CEC is used as a measure of soil fertility, nutrient retention capacity, and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation contamination. It is expressed as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g of dry soil (meq+/100g), or the SI unit centi-mol per kg (cmol+/kg).

In general, samples are dried, and sieved to fine fractions. Then the samples are extracted (often with 1 M NH4Cl); Extraxts are used for pH measurement for calculation of IE(H); other elements are measured from extract (often using with ICP OES). The effective cation exchange capacity is the sum of the single elements. Methods may slightly differ depending on the Protocol used and should be given in the respective dataset.

It is expressed as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g of dry soil (meq+/100g), or the SI unit centi-mol per kg (cmol+/kg).

In general, samples are dried, and sieved to fine fractions. Then the samples are extracted (often with 1 M NH4Cl); Extraxts are used for pH measurement for calculation of IE(H); other elements are measured from extract (often using with ICP OES). The effective cation exchange capacity is the sum of the single elements. Methods may slightly differ depending on the Protocol used and should be given in the respective dataset.

<para>Exchangable cations</para>
<para>In soil science, cation-exchange capacity or CEC is the number of exchangeable cations per dry weight that a soil is capable of holding, at a given pH value, and available for exchange with the soil water solution.[1] CEC is used as a measure of soil fertility, nutrient retention capacity, and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation contamination. It is expressed as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g of dry soil (meq+/100g), or the SI unit centi-mol per kg (cmol+/kg).

<attributeName>Base saturation (BS), %</attributeName>
<attributeLabel>BS</attributeLabel>
<attributeDefinition>Base saturation is the fraction of exchangeable cations that are base cations (Ca, Mg, K and Na). It can be expressed as a percentage, and called percent base saturation. The higher the amount of exchangeable base cations, the more acidity can be neutralised in the short time perspective. It is a measure of the general capacity of a soil to buffer changes in pH brought from external intput (e.g. rain).
In connection with information on the Cation Exchange Capacity of a certain soil, a soil with high cation-exchange capacity (assuming similar base saturations) takes longer time to acidify (as well as to recover from an acidified status) than a soil with a low cation-exchange capacity. 
A rain, with its load of acidic hydrogen ions, upon a soil that has a high CEC will be quickly returned (buffered) to its original pH in a very short time. A rain on a low CEC soil will not be restored and the pH will drop sharply and remain there for a relatively long time.

Base saturation (sum of Na, K, Ca, Mg in % of CECeff).  CECeff is the sum of all measured elements including H. (BS: base saturation, ratio between 0 and 100 %, sum of IEs(Na, K, Mg, Ca); as percentage of CECeff)</attributeDefinition>

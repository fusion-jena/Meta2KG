<abstract>
<para>The probability of a tree stem to break from an ice storm, if a random species was picked. The data results as random plot effects from a random effects model including taxon (species) and plot as random factors. Thus, breakage probability is standardized for species, as if a &quot;new&quot; random species was chosen. See the attached graphic for a plot that shows standardized breakage probability over the percentage of broken stems. The latter is biased by the species composition of the plot.</para>

<para>The underlying data combine both living and dead trees (dataset &quot;Living or killed trees after the 2008 ice storm&quot;, http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/239).</para>
<para>The random model was calculated with R: lmer_random_ml &lt;- lmer(mort_rank_broken ~ 1 + (1|plot) + (1|family/species), data = resid_mort, REML = F). This represents a random effects model. We extracted random effects like this: ranef(lmer_random_ml)$plot. We excluded all individuals without at least a genus attribute. We further excluded individuals belonging to plant families with less than 5 individuals in the whole dataset. Thus, individuals from rare families are excluded. --- The resulting species standardized breakage probability for plots can be used for further plot based inspections of multifuncionality.</para>

<attributeDefinition>Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve (29º8'18&quot; – 29º17'29&quot; N, 118º2'14&quot; – 118º11'12&quot; E, Zhejiang Province Southeast China), having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) and B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
Morover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) or Site B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the &quot;site&quot; information from another cell.
Plots labelled in the form of &quot;1_AO1&quot; or &quot;g1_AO1&quot; or &quot;pilot1_AO1&quot; belong to the &quot;Pilot Experiment&quot; (approx location:  29°06'20.2&quot;N 117°55'12.1&quot;E, Jiangxi Province) (CSP: Number of the CSP.)</attributeDefinition>

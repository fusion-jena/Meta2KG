<para>1) Objectives: -- a) Quantify “undisturbed” state prior to snow break. -- b) Quantify carbon and nitrogen stocks in aboveground CWD as a component of a full carbon and nitrogen budget.  -- c) Estimate turnover of CWD carbon depending on species, positioning and mortality i) Indirect carbon balance approach: Calculate deadwood input (I) to the forest floor by combining chronosequence data on woody increment and biomass. Calculate turnover  under assumption of equilibrium stocks (M/I)  ii) Direct approach: Revisit site after 2 to 3 years and measure position, take a sample to estimate density and volume loss (in-situ observations indicate a progression from a solid log to something substantially decayed within few months).  -- d) Compare species-specific sensitivities to snowbreak as a trait  i) Calculate the likelihood of being subject to snowbreak given the species, size and potentially the relative position using logistic regression   ii) Calculate the likelihood of snag survival; this requires re-sampling  iii) Estimate the down-slope transport of deadwood pieces   iv) Estimate the time it takes for deadwood to collapse and touch the forest floor  ----- File asset Plot_skizze.pdf: plot sketch how the debris objects are selected - File asset sp10 CWD_protocol_Gutianshan_AF_20081215_kn.doc: Inventory protocol, should be included into methods ----- 2) Objective allometries: use some of the downed or alive trees to establish coarse allometries to estimate volume of the remaining intems</para>

<para>one can use it to assess the snowbreak loss and the amount of woody debris; mind that there are extra parts measured of trees labelled &quot;allometries&quot;; these parts should not be included into extrapolation of woody debris mass. Check column descriptions for more information. Ignore the &quot;plotignore&quot; rows, since these are double counted. To combine these data with the data of the living trees, check the dataset on metal tags and coarse woody debris items &quot;Metal tags for coarse woody debris (CWD) items in the CSPs and corresponding metal tags and stem ids from the living tree data.&quot;.</para>

<attributeDefinition>Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve (29º8'18&quot; – 29º17'29&quot; N, 118º2'14&quot; – 118º11'12&quot; E, Zhejiang Province Southeast China), having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) and B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
Morover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) or Site B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the &quot;site&quot; information from another cell.
Plots labelled in the form of &quot;1_AO1&quot; or &quot;g1_AO1&quot; or &quot;pilot1_AO1&quot; belong to the &quot;Pilot Experiment&quot; (approx location:  29°06'20.2&quot;N 117°55'12.1&quot;E, Jiangxi Province) (CSP: k21 is CSP21, which was mapped by Christian and Karin, but was remapped by Anja and Thiemo.

<abstract>
<para>While coexistence in plant communities is frequently explained by effects of resource niche partitioning, the Janzen-Connell (J-C) hypothesis is an alternative approach that has been assumed as a major ecological mechanism explaining high species richness levels, in particular, in tropical forest ecosystems. Central components of the J-C hypothesis are non-competitive effects of density- and distance-dependence, thereby two drivers that contribute independently to species coexistence, but that are ultimately linked in the field. Here, we make use of the forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning project in subtropical China (BEF-China) to estimate density and distance dependence effects by means of a reciprocal tree seedling transplant experiment. Using monocultures of ten and seven tree species, respectively planted at two different sites, juveniles of all species were grown in their own (home) and in all other monocultures (away), thereby testing for distance effect, just as in three different levels of planting density, testing for density effects.

In addition, we repeated a similar set-up in a nearby common garden experiment, where we added a &#39;shadow&#39; treatment to simulate different light conditions induced by the canopy layer. The general aim of the common garden experiment is to test for additional density dependent intraspecific competition for light in the absence of host-specific agents necessary for J-C effects. Density dependent patterns that are prevalent in the main experiment, while not being prevalent in the common garden experiment can be considered true J-C effects (see &quot;Common Garden Experiment: Seedling addition experiment - growth and biomass data&quot; for further details)</para>

<samplingDescription>
<para>We implemented a reciprocal transplant experiment with juvenile plants using monocultures of 11 different tree species and following a home-away design, i.e. planting transplants in their own monoculture (home) and in a different one (away). The species represent a subset of the Main Experiment’s species pool and had been selected according to their representation at the two sites and finally included 6 evergreen and 5 deciduous species. From the species pool, 10 species were implemented at site A and 7 species at site B, thus 6 species were used on both sites. For each species, 3 monoculture plots were selected at each site and used for subplot implementation according to the project-specific experimental setup. The general design of BEF-China provides two ‘true’ replicates of each species’ monocultures at the plot level (i.e. where all 20 * 20 planted individuals belong to the same species). As a third replicate, we used 2-species mixtures including the respective target species and therein, all subplots were established in between four individuals of the target species.

All site-specific target species were planted in suplots either established in their own monoculture (home: 3 replicates each) or in monocultures of the other species within site (away: 9 species * 3 replicates, i.e. 27 plots site A and 18 for site B, respectively). Three monocultures in total, (1 in site A and 2 in site B) could not be realised. This approach was used to test for distance dependence. 

In order to test for effects of density-dependence, each subplot, was then subdivided in split-plots where tree seedlings were planted in conspecific communities at different density levels of 4, 9 and 25 individuals each. Accordingly, in target plots at site A, each five subplots (hosting each two species) were implemented, whereas at site B, the number of subplots per plot was lower because of the lower number of species tested. Thus, in each 29 and 19 plots (for site A and B, respectively), 5 and 4 subplots (for site A and B, respectively) were randomly allocated with each subplot 1.5 m x 1.0 m in size. Each splitplots occupied an area of 0.5 x 0.5 m in size. Species × density combinations were randomly allocated within subplot.</para>

<attributeDefinition>Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve (29º8'18&quot; – 29º17'29&quot; N, 118º2'14&quot; – 118º11'12&quot; E, Zhejiang Province Southeast China), having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) and B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
Morover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2&quot;N 117°54'27.5&quot;E) or Site B (29°05'06.8&quot;N 117°55'44.4&quot;E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the &quot;site&quot; information from another cell.
Plots labelled in the form of &quot;1_AO1&quot; or &quot;g1_AO1&quot; or &quot;pilot1_AO1&quot; belong to the &quot;Pilot Experiment&quot; (approx location:  29°06'20.2&quot;N 117°55'12.1&quot;E, Jiangxi Province) (PTAG: PTAG)</attributeDefinition>

<attributeName>Leaf Area Index (LAI) (LAI), </attributeName>
<attributeLabel>LAI</attributeLabel>
<attributeDefinition>Leaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2) in broadleaf canopies (Watson, D.J., 1947. Comparative physiological studies on the growth of field crops: I. Variation in net assimilation rate and leaf area between species and varieties and within and between years. Annals of Botany, 11: 41-76). In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used:
   - Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground surface area (Chen, J.M., and Black, T.A. (1992): Defining leaf area index for non-flat leaves. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 57: 1–12)
   - Projected (or one-sided, in accordance the definition for broadleaf canopies) needle area per unit ground area
   - Total needle surface area per unit ground area
LAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).
For details on which method has been used, see detailed methodology description of the dataset. (LAI: Leaf area index measured above the planted seedlings (1m height) in each subplot)</attributeDefinition>

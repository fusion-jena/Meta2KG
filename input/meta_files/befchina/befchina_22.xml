<samplingDescription>
<para>The splash cups consist of a PE flask to which a carrier system has been attached. In this carrier system a cup filled with a unit sand of 125-200 µm particle size is inserted. At the bottom of the cup a silk cover prevents loss of sand and guarantees free drainage of water from the cup to the carrier and vice versa. Cup and PE flask are hydraulically connected by a cotton wick to ensure constant moisture content throughout the time of measuring, as the initial water content is a crucial point in splash erosion studies (Poesen and Savat 1981). Additionally, vents in the carrier system ensure that the pressure arising from the insertion of the cup does not lead to loss of sand. The vent in the PE flask guarantees the free drainage of excess water which may accumulate during high intensity rainfall events.</para>

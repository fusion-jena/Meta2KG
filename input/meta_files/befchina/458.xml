<abstract>
<para>Soil erosion by water is an important process regarding ecosystem stability and ecosystem functions; this is especially true for subtropical regions with high intensity rainfall. Rainfall erosivity is one important factor in estimating soil erosion as an ecosystem function under forest. The power of raindrops to detach sediment at the soil surface is influenced by drop size and velocity. When passing through vegetation, rain drop size as well as rain drop velocity are changed depending on several vegetation parameters e.g. leaf area index (LAI). The role of biodiversity as one of these vegetation parameters on soil erosion processes is not yet clear and more information on the spatial distribution of throughfall under vegetation canopies is needed. To measure biodiversity effects on throughfall kinetic energy (TKE), splash cups have been used. 1800 Splash Cups were installed in the field during five different rainfall events on 40 plots with different tree diversity levels with a total of 24 tree species. For investigating spatial distribution of TKE, these splash cups have been set up in distinct distances from tree individuals (15cm, 30cm and 45cm away from stem, in the middle of two and four individuals, under the first branch, at the intersection of a 45cm and 105cm circle around two stems and one free from vegetation to determine freefall kinetic energy).</para>

<para>Main Experiment: Kinetic energy of rain drops in the main experiment - data</para>
<para>Soil erosion by water is an important process regarding ecosystem stability and ecosystem functions; this is especially true for subtropical regions with high intensity rainfall. Rainfall erosivity is one important factor in estimating soil erosion as an ecosystem function under forest. The power of raindrops to detach sediment at the soil surface is influenced by drop size and velocity. When passing through vegetation, rain drop size as well as rain drop velocity are changed depending on several vegetation parameters e.g. leaf area index (LAI). The role of biodiversity as one of these vegetation parameters on soil erosion processes is not yet clear and more information on the spatial distribution of throughfall under vegetation canopies is needed. To measure biodiversity effects on throughfall kinetic energy (TKE), splash cups have been used. 1800 Splash Cups were installed in the field during five different rainfall events on 40 plots with different tree diversity levels with a total of 24 tree species. For investigating spatial distribution of TKE, these splash cups have been set up in distinct distances from tree individuals (15cm, 30cm and 45cm away from stem, in the middle of two and four individuals, under the first branch, at the intersection of a 45cm and 105cm circle around two stems and one free from vegetation to determine freefall kinetic energy).</para>

General information: The splash cups consist of a PE flask to which a carrier system has been attached. In this carrier system a cup filled with a unit sand of 125-200 µm particle size is inserted. At the bottom of the cup a silk cover prevents loss of sand and guarantees free drainage of water from the cup to the carrier and vice versa. Cup and PE flask are hydraulically connected by a cotton wick to ensure constant moisture content throughout the time of measuring, as the initial water content is a crucial point in splash erosion studies (Poesen and Savat 1981). Additionally, vents in the carrier system ensure that the pressure arising from the insertion of the cup does not lead to loss of sand. The vent in the PE flask guarantees the free drainage of excess water which may accumulate during high intensity rainfall events. (position: Specific splash cup position on core area of each plot:

<attributeLabel>LAI</attributeLabel>
<attributeDefinition>Leaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2) in broadleaf canopies (Watson, D.J., 1947. Comparative physiological studies on the growth of field crops: I. Variation in net assimilation rate and leaf area between species and varieties and within and between years. Annals of Botany, 11: 41-76). In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used:
   - Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground surface area (Chen, J.M., and Black, T.A. (1992): Defining leaf area index for non-flat leaves. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 57: 1–12)
   - Projected (or one-sided, in accordance the definition for broadleaf canopies) needle area per unit ground area
   - Total needle surface area per unit ground area
LAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).
For details on which method has been used, see detailed methodology description of the dataset. (LAI: leaf area index (LAI) measured with Nikon D10 and analyzed in Hemi View over each splash cup position)</attributeDefinition>

The adopted Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings explains the documented risks that structures present to birds. Over thirty years of research has proven the risk to be ���biologically significant�۝ for certain bird species. Recent studies have determined that annual bird fatalities in North America from window collisions may be as high as 1 billion birds per year or 1-5% of all birds. While the facts are staggering, the solutions are within reach. The majority of these deaths are foreseeable and avoidable. The document summarizes proven successful remedies such as window treatments, lighting design, and lighting operation. The bird refuge maps out areas of particular risk to birds. These areas are within 300ft of: open water, inland water bodies greater than 2 acres in size, open space greater than 2 acres, the shoreline. For more information visit the Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings web site: http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=2506 A PDF map of the refuge is available here: http://www.sf-planning.org/ftp/files/publications_reports/library_of_cartography/Urban_Bird_Refuge_Poster.pdf The data is in zipped GIS shapefile format.
